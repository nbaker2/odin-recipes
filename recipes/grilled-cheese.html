      <li>Sliced smoked provolone cheese</li>
      <li>Sliced white cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>Sliced havarti cheese</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Take your butter, garlic, and shredded cheese, and mix together in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Spread some of your butter across both slices of sourdough.</li>
      <li>Add the cheeses on top of one of the slices of bread, buttered side down (in this order): 2 slices of provolone, 1 slice of white cheddar, 1 slice of havarti. If you prefer more gooiness, use 2 slices of cheddar. Top with the second slice of bread, buttered side up.</li>
      <li>Heat a skillet over medium to high heat. Once heated, add your sandwich to the skillet.</li>
      <li>When the bread is nice and crusty, flip (will be about 3-4 minutes depending on how hot the skillet is). Do the same for the other side.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
